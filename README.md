# ThinkDock (formerly LecturaX) 🛠️💡

ThinkDock is a mini AI toolkit that brings together quick, practical AI-powered tools in one clean dashboard.

Originally started as an ambitious EdTech project (LecturaX), it was left midway — but has now been revamped into a smaller, functional side project perfect for learning, experimenting, and showcasing full-stack skills.

The goal?
Make AI utilities accessible, minimal, and actually useful without the complexity of a giant platform.
