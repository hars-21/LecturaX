# Lecturax: The Chaos Edition üß™

Welcome to Lecturax, the EdTech platform where learning meets hilarious, unpredictable chaos. This project is a revival of an abandoned hackathon app, reimagined as a fun, interactive showcase of full-stack development and creative AI integration.

The core philosophy? Learning should be effective, but who says it can't be delightfully absurd?

**‚û°Ô∏è Live Demo: [LecturaX](https://lecturax.onrender.com/)**

**The Star Feature:** The Chaos Lecture

At the heart of Lecturax is a unique learning experience. Here's how it works:

    A user enters any topic they want to learn about.

    Our AI generates a comprehensive, well-structured lecture on that topic.

    The user then tries to read it.

The catch? The user interface actively works against you. The lecture becomes a dynamic entity that tries to break your concentration with a series of random, chaotic events.

Some of the chaos you might encounter:

**Shaky Text:** The very paragraph you're reading begins to tremble.

**Rebellious Scrollbar:** The scrollbar develops a mind of its own, resisting your control.

**Font Frenzy:** Text randomly switches to absurd fonts like Comic Sans or Wingdings.

**Word Replacer:** Key terms are spontaneously replaced with related emojis (e.g., "science" becomes "üß™").

**Sudden Banners:** Absurd and fake "Cookie Consent" or "Subscribe to our Newsletter" banners appear at the worst possible moments.

The challenge isn't just to learn the material, but to see if you can outlast the chaos!
